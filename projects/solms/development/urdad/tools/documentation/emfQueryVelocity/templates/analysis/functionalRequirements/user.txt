    <title>The user role</title>
    <para>
        The user role is the role played by those objects which make use of the use case. It is represented by an interface/contract
        which accumulates the contractual obligations of the user itself.

          <para>
            URDAD requires that a single user role is assigned to each use case. The user role needs to be represented by
            an interface and there should be an association relationship between the use case and interface/contract
            representing the user role.

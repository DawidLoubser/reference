\section{Evaluating an URDAD based design}

In order to assess an URDAD based design one will
\begin{itemize}
   \item check that at single level of granularity, i.e.\ that
   \begin{itemize}
		\item only the direct functional requirements are included and not the functional requirements
				of functional requirements,
		\item all requests to service providers come from the controller and are not the lower level
				requests from one service provider to another.
   \end{itemize}
   \item validate that each functional requirement is indeed addressed by an activity in the business process,
   \item assess the grouping of functional requirements into responsibility domains in
             order to verify that there are no overlaps between responsibility domains and that
             each responsibility domain does indeed comprise a single responsibility,
    \item verify that the process at any level of granularity is intuitive and simple,
    \item verify that the service providers are represented by services contracts (UML interfaces) and 
              not by implementation or technology specific classes,
    \item verify that each services contract has been fully specified including the functional and
              non-functional requirements,
    \item verify that the structure of all exchanged value objects is defined using class diagrams.
\end{itemize}

\begin{abstract}
  This paper formulates a set of minimal requirements for the
  Platform Independent Model (PIM) of the Model Driven Architecture
  (MDA). It then defines the Use Case, Responsibility Driven Analysis and
  Design methodology (URDAD) which provides a simple, algorithmic
  design methodology generating a PIM satisfying the specified PIM
  requirements.

%%                             Refereee concerns
%%
%%  Referee 1:
%%  ==========
%%    - support with real-life experiences
%%        => addressed in a new subsection entitled "Real-life experiences with URDAD"
%%    - differences betw URDAD & stepwise refinement
%%        => added "Analysis and design methodologies" subsection of introduction to address this
%%    - how to fix levels of granularity in practice
%%       => The second and third paragraph of the section titled "The analysis phase of URDAD"
%%          has been rewritten to address this. The concepts are further enforced at the start
%%          of the analysis section of the example
%%    - major: review related MDA work, refinement processes, design & developments processes
%%        => partially addressed by additions to the "MDA-based development methodologies"
%%           subsection of introduction
%%    - include transformation viewpoint: process may configure & control set of transformation tasks
%%        => partially alluded to in "Analysis and design methodologies" subsection of introduction
%%        => discussed in a new model transformations section
%%    - what about intermediate PIMs (human comprehensible, ...)
%%        => We don't envisage intermediate PIMs. Humans should preferably have to deal with
%%           only a single set of artifacts. We would, however, see the benefit of multiple levels
%%           of PSMs at times. The fact that mappings typically involve a series of intermediate PSMs
%%				 is alluded to in the added section on model transformations
%%    - larger figures
%%    - last section before chapter 5 is unclear
%%        => has been rewritten
%%    - footnote on p17 too stand-alone
%%        => The footnote has been replaced by an in-text paragraph and the content has been
%%				reformulated in a more understandable way
%%
%%  Referee 2:
%%  ==========
%%    - case studies
%%        => referred to in the new subsection entitled "Real-life experiences with URDAD"
%%    - illustration figures used at SOMET'07 omitted - why?
%%        => have added the figure for a typical model-driven development process and for the collaboration context.
%%    - integrate issues mentioned in SOMET'07 to complete paper
%%        => have done so
%%    - show integration betw business process design, IT, project performance, business performance
%%      with reference to vendor-independent, business management knowledge base.
%%			=> this concern has not been dealt with in depth - it is partially alluded to in the added section
%%				"MDA-based development methodologies".
%%    - what is good process design from different points of view (PM, management, user, implementor, ...)
%%			=> this issue has been addressed by additions to the last paragraph of the section titles "Design quality drivers"
%%    - compare more to existing approaches
%%			=> addressed by additions to the "Analysis and design methodologies" subsection of introduction
%%    - transition across levels of granularity discussed in too abstract terms
%%       => this entire section has been rewritten in less abstract terms.
%%    - how to ensure compatibility betw outputs of technology neutral BP design & implementation?
%%         => partially discussed in the URDAD meta-model as mentioned in model transformations section
%%    - business processes need to be employed in environment ensuring certain qualities.
%%      How addressed?
%%			  => Discussed in a new section titled "Quality of service"
%%         => Needs/requirements for this mentioned in inputs for implementation mappings
%%    - How is minimal structure achieved?
%%         => Explained in the last paragraph added to the section titled "The design phase of URDAD".
%%    - Need repository to trace across levels of granularity?
%%         => Added a subsection to the Methodologies section titled "Navigating the PIM".
%%    - How to discover appropriate domains of responsibility? How to ensure no overlaps?
%%         => Rewrote first paragraph of "The design phase of URDAD" to explain this better.
%%    - Justify usage of diagrams (why minimal, complete set and why in that order?) Why not other
%%      like component/composite structure diagrams for system structure, ...
%%         => Added a subsection entitled "Choice of UML diagrams" to the modeling languages section.
%%    - Not all figures referred to in paper (e.g. figure 8)
%%          => fixed
%%    - Include how to evaluate URDAD based design
%%			=> addressed in new section "Evaluating URDAD based design"
%%
%%  Referee 3:
%%  ==========
%%    - how to guarantee technology mapping automation?
%%        => partially addressed by the new model transformations section.
%%    - clearer statement of original contribution of this work
%%        => added "Analysis and design methodologies" subsection of introduction to address this
%%    - add : to eol before start of bulleted lists
%%    - shorten figure captions
%%        => done
%%    - check typo/language comments (many)
%%        => done

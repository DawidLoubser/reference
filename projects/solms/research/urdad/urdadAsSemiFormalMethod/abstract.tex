The Use Case, Responsibility Driven Analysis and Design (URDAD) methodology, is
a methodology for technology neutral design generating the Platform Independent
Model (PIM) of the Object Management Group's (OMG's) Model Driven Architecture (MDA).
It requires the core modeling to be done in the problem space by
domain specialists and not in the solution space by technology specialists.
URDAD allows for formal elements to be
added by different role players at different stages of the model refinement,
whilst aiming to preserve agility of the outputs and low cost of the process
generating the outputs.
This paper discusses the semi-formal aspects of URDAD
which facilitate modeling validation and testing, documentation
generation and automated implementation mapping as well as aspects
which promote agility and low cost.

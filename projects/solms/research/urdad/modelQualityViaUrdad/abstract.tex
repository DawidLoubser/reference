URDAD, the {\em Use Case, Responsibility Driven Analysis and Design} process is a process which generates the {\em Platform Independent Model} (PIM) of OMG's framework for model driven development, the {\em Model Driven Architecture} (MDA). The quality of a PIM is crucial since
an inferior quality PIM compromises any further models and artifacts which are generated from the PIM through model transformation and artifact generation technologies. An URDAD generated PIM has a formally defined model structure. In this paper we endeavour to qualitatively assess to what extent an URDAD PIM realizes stake holder 
quality requirements for the PIM.

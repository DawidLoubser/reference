URDAD \cite{solms_2007:technologyNeutralBpdUsingUrdad} \cite{solms_2009:generatingMdasPimUsingUrdad}
\cite{solms_2010:urdadAsSemiFormalApproach}
is a service centric analysis and design methodology which is aimed in generating MDA's PIM. An URDAD
model has a defined model structure and corresponding UML/OCL encoding which is meant to simplify
tasks like model transformation and model validation.

It is envisaged that the contest provides an opportunity to independently assess on the one side the 
suitability of an URDAD model for model transformation tasks like implementation mapping, test suite
and documentation generation and, on the other side, to assess model transformation tools' ability
to perform the above tasks on an URDAD compliant UML model.

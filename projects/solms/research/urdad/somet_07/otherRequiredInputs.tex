\section{Other required inputs}

The provided model on its own does and should not contain sufficient information to perform the required
model transformations for an implementation mapping. The model is a technology neutral analysis and
design model and does not contain a specification of the target architecture and technologies. These still
need to be specified separately.

The target architecture and technologies can be either specified implicitly through a manual choice of model
transformation elements or explicitly facilitating the dynamic choice of suitable model transformation elements
for the target architecture. Both of these are outside the scope of the provided model.

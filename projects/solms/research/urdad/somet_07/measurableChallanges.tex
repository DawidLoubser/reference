\section{Measurable challanges}

The project would measure the strength of the input model as well as the ability of model transformation frameworks
to perform their targeted model transformation tasks on the model.

The targeted model transformations could include
\begin{itemize}
  \item implementation mapping of the source model onto target architectures and technologies,
  \item unit test generation for services contracts in the model,
  \item documentation generation from the model including a full UML to English mapping of the content and semantics
of the model.
\end{itemize}

In this context one can measure 
\begin{itemize}
  \item the amount of missing information and or semantics to facilitate the targeted transformations,
  \item the ability of the framework to point out model deficiencies, inconsistencies, and completeness issues,
  \item the ability of a transformation framework to extract the contained information form the source model,
  \item the ability of the transformation framework to perform the actual transformation,
  \item the abilit of the transformation framework to absorb variations and process specification of target
  architectures and technologies.
\end{itemize}

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercises}
  \item Write a Parabola class whose instances have specific values for 
        the 2'nd, 1'st and 0'th order coefficients, $a$, $b$ and $c$.
        The parabola should offer services for calculating the turning
        point and roots of the class as well as for calculating the function
        value for any given $x$-value. Separate the header from the
        implementation file.
        
  \item Write a simple stack class (you may want to use a singly-linked
        list as underlying collection algorithm) which holds a collection of
        Parabolas. You should be able to push Parabolas onto the stack
        and be able to pop the off the stack. All objects should be
        created n the heap and you shuld take care that the application
        is save from memory leaks.

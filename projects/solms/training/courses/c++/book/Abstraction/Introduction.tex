\section{Introduction}

In many ways the power of object-orientation comes from the support for
abstraction, enabling developers to work at very abstract
and general levels and facilitating the development of very generic solutions.
Of course, at times one has to work at a very specific level and that too is
cleanly facilitated through object-orientation.

There are mainly two mechanisms through which abstraction is achieved,
superclasses and interfaces. The former has more an implementation focus while
the latter is driven more by client needs.

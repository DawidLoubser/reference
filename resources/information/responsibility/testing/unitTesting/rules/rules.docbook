                <title>Test against functional contracts</title>
                <para>
                    Tests should be written against the public interface and should test the functional contracts.

                <para>
                    The running of one test should not have to require another test to be run first and should not
                    prevent the concurrent running of other tests.

            <listitem><para>
                The test should not interact with any resources which is outside the class being tested and not provided by the test itself. 
            </para></listitem>
            <listitem><formalpara>
                <title>Unit tests should be fully automated and non-interactive </title>
                <para>
                    Unit tests should not require any user input and should be able to be executed within an automated
                    environment.

# It talks to the database
# It communicates across the network
# It touches the file system
# It can't run at the same time as any of your other unit tests
# You have to do special things to your environment (such as editing config files) to run it.

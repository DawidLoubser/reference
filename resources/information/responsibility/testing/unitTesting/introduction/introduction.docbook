        Unit testing is concerned with testing functionality. As such they test the boundary of an implementation,
        not the implementation details per se. In other words, a unit test should test an object from the user's perspective,
        not from the perspective of the implementation logic. The latter should ideally be tested via a (preferably switchable) internal 
        <emphasis>assertions</emphasis> mechanism.

    <title>Testing contracts instead of classes</title>

    <para>
        Since unit tests should test <emphasis>functionality from the user's perspective</emphasis>, and since the user 
        requirements should be encapsulated in a <emphasis>services contract</emphasis>, unit tests should be preferably 
        written against the contracts, instead of any particular implementation classes. A full services contract must have 
        all the information required to write the unit test, otherwise the services contract does not fully specify the 
        user's functional requirements.
    </para>
    <para>
        Any implementation class representing (service provider) should
        be tested against all the contracts which that implementation class claims to (directly or indirectly) realise.
        Unfortunately, most common unit testing frameworks (JUnit, NUnit) do not offer this feature, and instead
        assume that the developer wishes to work at a class-level.

        Unit tests should test the <emphasis>functional contract</emphasis>. In particular they should test each of the services specified
        in the contract or class and establish the following:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>
                If all pre-conditions are met, the service is provided as per contract.
            </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>
                An exceptions is only thrown if one of the preconditions is not met. The exception thrown is that exception which
                corresponds to the precondition (e.g. if the pre-condition of sufficient funds is not met, that
                an <literal>InsufficientFundsException</literal> is thrown).
            </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>
                After a service has been provided all post-conditions for that service are satisfied. This includes any post conditions
                of the result object as well as any post-conditions representing effects on the state of the service provider itself
                (if not stateless) and on the environment of the service provider.
            </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>
                All success and failure scenarios should be tested.
            </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>
                Contracts/classes at all levels of granularity should be tested.
            </para></listitem>

    <title>The scope of an organization</title>
    <para> The high level scope of an organization's operations is usually defined by its mission
        statement. For example, the scope of a landscaping services provider may be to design,
        establish and maintain landscaped gardens. This high level scope of the organization could
        be documented using a use case diagram. </para>

    <title>Perform all file operations from subversion</title>
    <para>
        Whenever you need to copy, delete, move or rename files or folders in the repository, do so using the corresponding 
        file operations in the version control system.1 If this is done only on the local file system, the history of those changes 
        will be lost forever.

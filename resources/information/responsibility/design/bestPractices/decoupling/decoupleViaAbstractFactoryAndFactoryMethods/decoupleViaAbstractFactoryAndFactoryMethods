    <title>Decoupling via Abstract Factory</title>
    <para>
        The abstract factory pattern is one of the patterns which enables one to decouple from an entire 
        framework. In the abstract factory pattern, the client side is decoupled from both, the concrete
        factory which provides concrete framework components and the concrete framework components
        themselves. This facilitates pluggability of entire frameworks.

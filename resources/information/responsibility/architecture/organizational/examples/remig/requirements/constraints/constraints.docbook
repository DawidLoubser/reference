    <title>Architectural constraints</title>
    <para>
        The only architectural constraint we are currently aware of is that the organization and the syste,s supporting the organization need to be
        able to operate outside the country where the services are provided. The vision was mentioned to move the company and its system to
        Ireland and operate the electricity provision into Africa and other regions from Ireland.

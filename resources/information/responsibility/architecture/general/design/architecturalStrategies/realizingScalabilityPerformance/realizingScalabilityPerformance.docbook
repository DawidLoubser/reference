    SCALE-OUT
    =======
    network clustering (distribute/load-balance TCP requests)
    distributed persistence (e.g. Domain Name System scales well)
    partition functionality, data, ... (e.g. Google's master & chunk servers)
    scale based architectures
    
    Flickr went to a federated approach so they can scale far into the future:
    - Shards: My data gets stored on my shard, but the record of performing action on your comment, 
    is on your shard. When making a comment on someone else'sâ€™ blog
  

    AND THIS???
    ========
    - Offload processing as much forward as possible (client side request validation, processing from presentation layer, ...)
    

- Find bottlenecks (e.g. database)

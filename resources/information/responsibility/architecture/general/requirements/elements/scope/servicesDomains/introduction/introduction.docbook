        In order to be able to define an architecture which satisfies the client's needs, one needs to have an understanding
        of the types of services the client intends to deploy within the architecture.  One usually starts by first determining
        the core services which the client intends to host within the architecture. After the core services have been identified,
        one needs to obtain an understanding of the types of auxillary services required to be hosted within the architecture.

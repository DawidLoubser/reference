  <ns3442:para xmlns:ns3442="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">
    Organizations which see modifiable work flows as one of their core capabilities often make extensive use of 
    the pipes and filters pattern. Here business units take over the responsibility of individual work flow steps.
    Business processes are defined as work flows across these business (processing) units.
    The idea is that one can very easily assemble and modify business processes within this architecture.

    For example, the dispatching work flow of an online retailer could be altered to include gift wrapping under certain
    circumstances or even to include a work flow step which insures the goods in transit. In a pipes
    and filters based architecture, such additional work flow steps can be easily inserted, others
    may be removed and yet others may be optional.

    <ns3448:para xmlns:ns3448="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">
      When setting up a pipes and filters architecture one needs to start with a clean responsibility allocation
      across business units. Each business unit is given a domain of responsibility and executes the
      work flow steps which fall in that domain of responsibility.

    <ns3451:para xmlns:ns3451="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">
      Managing large pipes and filters based organizations is non-trivial. Traditionally one would 
      tend to put a hierarchy on top of the pipes and filters structure which is based on domains 
      of responsibility, <ns3452:abbrev xmlns:ns3452="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">i.e.</ns3452:abbrev> based on a groupings of the processing units.
    </ns3451:para>
    <ns3453:para xmlns:ns3453="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">
      However, work flows are typically constructed across these domains of responsibility. 
      Such an approach would thus result in a situation where the responsibility for the entire
      business process or client service would not be localized and hence a situation where there is
      no clear ownership of business processes or client services. Furthermore, making changes to an
      existing business process or introducing a new business process would require buy-in across
      the hierarchical elements responsible for the different domains of responsibility. This would
      have a negative impact on the core capability this pattern aims to realize, flexibility. 
    </ns3453:para>
    <ns3454:para xmlns:ns3454="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">
      Instead, one usually uses a relatively flat hierarchy where responsibility assignment is done
      on groupings of client services or business processes instead of on groupings of domains of
      responsibility. The result is that there is direct ownership and accountability of client
      services and business processes as a whole. Furthermore, changing a business process would not
      impact on different hierarchical elements. The business unit responsible for that particular
      work flow would simply execute the changes across the processing units which act as lower level
      services providers.

      The lower level service providers may be internal business units or external service
      providers. In either case these service providers would provide services to different higher
      level business units. This is because different services offered by different higher level
      business units may require the same work flow steps or at least services from the same lower
      level service provider. In such a situation one would always want to put service level
      agreements (SLAs) in place, irrespective of whether the lower level service provider is an
      internal business unit or an external service provider.

  Modifiability is one of the most important quality attributes of an architecture.
  It is very difficult to anticipate the potential changes which a system may face over
  its lifespan. To this end we need to be able to cost effectively apply potentially
  unanticipated changes at various stages during the lifespan of the system.

    Modifiability is an inverse measure of the cost associated with changing a system.

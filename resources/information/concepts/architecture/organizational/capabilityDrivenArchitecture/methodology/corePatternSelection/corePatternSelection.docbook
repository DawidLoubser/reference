  <ns3768:para xmlns:ns3768="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">
    The next step suggested by CDA is that of selecting the core organizational pattern used to bind
    the core capability domains into a cohesive whole.  The architectural patterns have been
    combined in such a way that the organizational 
    infrastructure is aligned with the mission for the organization, <ns3769:abbrev xmlns:ns3769="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">i.e.</ns3769:abbrev> that we
    have an infrastructure within which the envisaged capabilities for the organization can be
    realized.

    For example, should the organization regard accountability as the core capability of management,
    then one would most probably want to embed the capability domains within a hierarchy
    covering the different responsibilities of these domains. On the other hand, should ingenuity
    and or flexibility be seen as a core requirement for management, then
    one would want to minimize the hierarchical elements within management itself.

      Solms TCD requires ingenuity, quality and flexibility in the client faced areas
      of the organization (client services and marketing). These were thus realized within the expert

      Operational support, on the other hand, is envisaged to provide a solid, slowly evolving core
      of backbone services with emphasis on reliability, accountability and flexible work flows. We
      thus introduced a responsibility hierarchy for operational support enforcing responsibility
      localization and accountability.

      The actual business processes for the support services should, however, provide a reasonable
      level of flexibility. In order to support flexible workflows, we specified that these
      departments will operate within a pipes and filters framework.

          Ingenuity, quality and flexibility are the core organizational capabilities. These qualities
          should also be present in the strategic management of the organization. For this
          reason most strategic decisions within the organization are not made by individuals, but by the
          top layer management operating within an expert pool pattern itself. The controller for the
          management expert pool is the CEO. Management itself is thus a dynamic external server

    Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architecture that separates an application's <emphasis>data model</emphasis>, 
    <emphasis>user interface</emphasis>, and <emphasis>control logic</emphasis> into three distinct components so that 
    modifications to the view component can be made with minimal impact to the data model component. 
    MVC is often thought of as a software design pattern. However, MVC encompasses more of the 
    architecture of an application than is typical for a design pattern.

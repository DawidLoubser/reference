    <ns2520:para xmlns:ns2520="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">One of the best descriptions of database storage integration is that of triggers in a
        database. These triggers are set to fire when a certain event occurs. The trigger can be
        used to alert users that an event has taken place for example, or it could also be used to
        dump a newer copy of the database to a specific location as well. This is entirely
        customisable by the user for his/her specific enterprise requirements.

        <ns2523:para xmlns:ns2523="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Triggers offer database developers and administrators a tremendous degree of
            flexibility. They are, quite simply, stored procedures that may be configured to
            automatically execute when certain events take place.</ns2523:para>
        <ns2524:para xmlns:ns2524="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">All enterprise-level relational databases support triggers in one form or another.
            We'll take a brief look at the syntax used by Microsoft SQL Server, but the basic
            concepts in this article apply equally to Oracle databases. There are only some slight
            differences in keywords and formatting. </ns2524:para>

        <ns2527:para xmlns:ns2527="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Notice that triggers are stored in the database separate from their associated tables.
            Triggers can be defined only on tables, not on views. However, triggers on the base
            table(s) of a view are fired if an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement is issued against
            a view. </ns2527:para>
        <ns2528:para xmlns:ns2528="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">The basic command used to create a new trigger is the CREATE TRIGGER statement. This
            statement is followed by the details of when the trigger should fire. Triggers may be
            associated with INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE events and may be used either INSTEAD OF or
            AFTER the specified operation. Once you've specified the trigger criteria, you supply
            the SQL statement that contains the trigger's payload. For example, if we wanted to
            configure a simple trigger to send an e-mail to the president each time a record is
            removed from the Orders table, we would use the following syntax: <ns2529:programlisting xmlns:ns2529="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">
            CREATE TRIGGER OrderRemoved ON Orders
            AFTER DELETE
            AS
            EXEC xp_sendmail 'info@solms.co.za','A record has been deleted.'

        </ns2528:para>
        <ns2530:para xmlns:ns2530="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">If you later get an angry phone call from someone on the info mailing list asking you
            to stop sending him e-mail and decide to redirect your messages to the just the db
            administrator, you could modify the trigger using the ALTER TRIGGER command, which has
            the same basic syntax: <ns2531:programlisting xmlns:ns2531="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">
                
                
                
            ALTER TRIGGER OrderRemoved ON Orders
            AFTER DELETE
            AS
            EXEC xp_sendmail 'dbAdmin@solms.co.za','A record has been deleted.' 
            </ns2531:programlisting>
        </ns2530:para>
        <ns2532:para xmlns:ns2532="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> If you forget the name of your trigger, you may obtain a list of all of the triggers
            that fire based upon the Orders table by using the command: <ns2533:programlisting xmlns:ns2533="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">
           sp_helptrigger Orders 
            </ns2533:programlisting>

        <ns2534:para xmlns:ns2534="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">If you'd like to view the SQL behind a specific trigger, you may view it by issuing
            the command:<ns2535:programlisting xmlns:ns2535="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">
            sp_helptrigger Orders 
            </ns2535:programlisting>
        </ns2534:para>
        <ns2536:para xmlns:ns2536="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Finally, if you later decide that you want to completely remove a trigger, the syntax is:<ns2537:programlisting xmlns:ns2537="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">
            DROP TRIGGER OrderRemoved 
            </ns2537:programlisting>
        </ns2536:para>
        <ns2538:para xmlns:ns2538="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Triggers add a tremendously powerful capability to database servers. The examples
            mentioned above are relatively trivial, but you should keep in mind that triggers are
            indeed stored procedures and you may use them to perform any action that a stored
            procedure can perform. This includes calling other stored procedures, accessing
            information from other data sources and modifying the contents of other database
        tables.</ns2538:para>

  <title>Failures versus faults</title>
  <para>
    A failure occurs when a service is not available to the users in  the form it is advertised
    in the contract. As such, a service is visible by users. 
  </para>
  <para>
    A fault, on the other hand, is an
    internal error which may evolve into a failure if the fault is not handled internally.

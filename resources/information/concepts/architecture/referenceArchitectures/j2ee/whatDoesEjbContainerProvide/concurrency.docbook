      The application server automatically supports concurrent service requests
      via multiple bean instantiation, <ns612:abbrev xmlns:ns612="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">i.e.</ns612:abbrev> concurrent service requests are
      processed by different bean instances. Bean developers need thus not 
      worry about writing multi-threaded servers -- in fact they are forbidden
      to do so because that would interfere with the containers concurrency 
      support.

      Furthermore, in the case where the different client bean instances share 
      common data resources the container takes over the responsibility of
      synchronizing the different data views.

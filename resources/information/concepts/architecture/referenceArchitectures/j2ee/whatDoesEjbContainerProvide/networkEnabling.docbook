    Bean developers need not make the beans network-enabled. The container
    automatically supports distributed architectures by wrapping the
    bean instances by bean objects which are network enabled. These bean
    objects <ns676:emphasis xmlns:ns676="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">intercept</ns676:emphasis> bean service requests, 
    in order to provide the other services like transaction, 
    security and persistence. Every EJB is published
    as both an RMI and a CORBA object, and can easily (through the
    use of Java annotations) be published as a Web Service as well.

  <title>Quality and productivity</title>
  <para>
    K. Fujino's quote,
    <blockquote>
      <para><emphasis>when quality is pursued, productivity follows</emphasis></para>
    </blockquote>
    has become a widely accepted mantra.

  <para>
    In other words, it is been proven unwise to believe that
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>
        your deadlines are too pressing to follow a quality-driven approach
        like design by contract,  
      </para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
     but rather that
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>
        you cannot afford <emphasis>not</emphasis> to follow a quality driven 
        approach with pressing deadlines.
      </para></listitem>

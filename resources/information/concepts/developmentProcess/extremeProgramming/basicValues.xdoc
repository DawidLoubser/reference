  <title>The 4 basic values of XP</title>
  <para> 
      XP is based on 4 core values which drive the entire process and its practices: 
      <itemizedlist>

     <title>Communication</title>
     <para> 
        Constant communication with the client is facilitated in XP by requiring that the
        customer should always be on-site. Communication between developers is driven
        partially by introducing the concept of pair programming. The customer decides what
        will be built and in what order.
     </para>

    <section>
      <title>Simplicity</title>
      <para> 
        Constant refactoring of the design and code is introduced in XP to ensure that
        simplicity is continuously maximized. Furthermore, XP requires a minimal set of
        non-code artifacts (status reports, formal requirements specifications, grant charts, â€¦).

    <title>Architectural rationale</title>
    <para>
        IEEE 1471 requires that, in addition to the views, an architectural description should explain the rationale behind the
        architecture. This would typically include justification of architectural choices, showing how alternatives were considered
        and assessed as well as explaining the architectural trade-off decisions made.

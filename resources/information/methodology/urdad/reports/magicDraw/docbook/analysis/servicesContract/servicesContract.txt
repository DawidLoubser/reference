            The service contract specification diagram shown in 
            <xref linkend="$diagramId"/>
            specifies the contract (interface) name, the service with the request and response objects, the pre- and post-conditions
            and the quality requirements for the service.
        </para>
        <para>
            The pre-conditions are those conditions under which the service may be refused without being in breach of services contract.
            The post-conditions are those conditions which must hold true once the service has been rendered.
            The quality requirements are the non-functional requirements.

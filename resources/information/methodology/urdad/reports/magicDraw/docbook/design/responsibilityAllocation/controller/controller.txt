        The controller takes ownership of the business process and manages the business process for the use case.
        The controller is responsible for assembling the business process across lower level services sourced from
        service providers realizing lower level services contracts. All work flow decisions and control logic are
        executed by the controller. As such the controller also decouples the lower level service providers from
        one another, <abbrev>i.e.</abbrev> the lower level service providers are have know knowledge of either
        the business process within which the services are used or any other service providers participating in the
        business process.

            <para>
                For a designed business process, URDAD requires that at least one service/operation has been assigned to
                realize the use case (via a realization relationship between the use case and the service).
                This service will be hosted by the controller which is responsible for assembling the business process
                for the use case from services sourced from other service providers.

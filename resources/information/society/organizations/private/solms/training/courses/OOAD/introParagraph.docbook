    This course covers UML-2 with a focus on model driven development.
    Candidates learn how to take use-case based requirements through technology neutral
    design, generating a robust, flexible platform independent model. The course illustrates
    how the platform independent design can be mapped onto one's choice of
    implementation architectures and technologies.

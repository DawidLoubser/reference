    This course covers approaches, technologies and architectures that enable the integration of
    components and systems. This course looks at the higher-level mechanisms and strategies
    through which integration can be achieved (e.g. shared resource, messaging, synchronous and
    asynchronous services, etc) and then looks at various technologies that realise these.
  
    This course is strongly focused on XML and Web Services, but also looks at a broad range of technologies,
    from simple TCP/IP networking, through distributed computing technologies such as RMI and CORBA, to messaging
    services and database-based integration. The course also includes a solid overview of Services-Oriented
    architecture, as well as BPEL to orchestrate integration across diverse services.

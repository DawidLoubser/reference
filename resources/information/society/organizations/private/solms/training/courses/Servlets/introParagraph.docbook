    This course focuses on putting web-based presentation layers in place for enterprise applications,
    using the Java Servlets API and JSF. This is typically done for an EJB-based business layer, but accommodates other scenarios
    such a business layer written in another technology (such as .NET) accessed via SOAP.
  
    This course assumes a recent (Java EE version 5) deployment environment, but the concepts and techniques are equally
    applicable to older versions of the specifications.

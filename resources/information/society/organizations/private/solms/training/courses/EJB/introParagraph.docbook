    In addition to providing a solid understanding of the Java EE architecture in general,
    this course teaches developers how to write EJB components to realise the business
    logic layer of a system.
  
    The course emphasises productivity and simplicity by focusing on EJB version 3 (as part
    of Java EE version 5), although the concepts learnt are equally applicable to earlier versions
    of the standard.

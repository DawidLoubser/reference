      Candidates should have prior experience in developing Java-based systems,
      and should know the Java language at the level of our
     Programming in Java course.
      A basic understanding of the Unified Modeling Language will increase the value
      candidates will extract from this course, as the correct mapping of UML to
      entity objects are also covered.

    Architecture is one of our core courses. Unlike most other Architecture courses it is not biased 
    towards
    any particular reference architecture like J2EE, .Net or Service-Oriented Architectures. Instead
    this course enables candidates to derive, evaluate and validate architectures based on
    the required quality attribute weightings for a system.

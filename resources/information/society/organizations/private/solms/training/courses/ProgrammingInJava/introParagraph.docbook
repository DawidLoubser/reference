    xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"> This introductory course aims to convey a solid
    understanding of object-oriented concepts, and their implementation in Java. It also covers the
    most widely used Java SE frameworks, such as the Collections framework, Streaming Input/Output,
    and creating graphical user interfaces with Swing. The course also serves as a product-neutral,
    practical introduction to Java development in general - covering aspects such as the usage of
    Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) as well as automatic documentation generation. </para>

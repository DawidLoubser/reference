    <para>
        Students may enroll manually by either <emphasis>faxing</emphasis> an enrollment form, or 
        by physically providing the form to us. Manual enrollment is discouraged, as it is in the
        student's best interest to enroll himself on the website (having control over his own
        profile information / login details).

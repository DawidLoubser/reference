        <h1>Welcome to the world of XHTML</h1>
        <h2>(The gentleman's HTML)</h2>
        <p>
            XHTML documents, like this one, enable a standard method
            of communicating across the web. Without standards like
            these, the web cannot continue to evolve in a controlled

                pages erupted into &quot;tag soup&quot;, manifested 
                in its most extreme form in the impure 
                <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
                version 4.0.
            </li>
            <li>
                XHTML attempts to eradicate the mess of the 1990s, and
                bring balance to the online universe. But the road is
                long...

mvn clean install

will run the unit test which launches the name server and ORB and
rund a test against the CORBA server.

When running the server stand-alone, Make sure that the name server 
has been started via, for example 
  	tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 2000
 
You can then start the server via
	java -jar target/client-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -ORBInitialPort 2000

Finally you can run the client via 
	java -jar client-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -ORBInitialPort 2000

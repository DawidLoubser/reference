	<title>Connecting to the apache web server</title>
	<para>
	To access contents published on a webserver, typically a webbrowser such as Mozilla, Netscape, Konqueror or Galeon are used. Command line applications to access web contents are also available, and Unix / Linux offers a number of them. Lynx and Links are but a few examples of command line web browsers.</para>

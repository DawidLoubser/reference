	<title>Secure Remote Shell</title>
	<para>
	On most popular distributions the SSH server (SSHD) is already installed. During the first initialisation of the SSHD service a keypairs is generated for RSA1(SSH1), RSA(SSH2) and DSA(SSH2) connections. This keypair consists of a public and private key. The public key is sent to clients during the initial connection handshake and stored on the client. The client uses the server public keys to authenticate the server on subsequent connection attempts. Should the key for the server have been tempered with, or a new key been generated on the server the client receives a warning during the handshake.

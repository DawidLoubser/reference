	<title>CD Writing</title>
	<para>
	Linux does not directly support writing to IDE CD writers, but with SCSI emulation, it is possible to emulate a SCSI interface through which the IDE cd writer can be accessed. This is performed by appending hdc=ide-scsi and hdclun=0 to the kernel parameters at boot time. SCSI emulation support also needs to be built into the kernel, which it is by default on Redhat and Suse distributions. The parameters can also be included in the bootloader configuration file as follows :

		<title>Creating an ISO image</title>

		The easiest option is to create an iso image containing the date to be burned onto the cd, and then burn the entire image. An image can be created from an existing cdrom, as well as a set of folders.

			<para>
			Often it is desirable to copy the contents of a set of folders onto a cdrom. To begin, we create an iso image with the contents intended for the cdrom. The mkisofs (Make ISO filesystem) utility does exactly that.

The speed option, for example, suggests a speed to be used and can be enforced with the <emphasis role="strong">forcespeed</emphasis> option. The dev directive specifies the bus (obtained from cdrecord -scanbus), and the eject option ejects the cd after the burn process is completed.

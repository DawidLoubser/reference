    <title>What is a persistence context?</title>
    <para>
        A persistence context is a cache of objects whose persistence is managed. The cache maintains objects in memory
        which can be efficiently manipulated without every time having to consult the database.
    </para>
    <para>
        The persistence context typically maintains a set of
        non-shared database connections. Only one instance with the same object identity
        exists within a persistence context.

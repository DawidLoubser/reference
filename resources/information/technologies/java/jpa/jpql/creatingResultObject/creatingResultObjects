    <title>Constructing result objects</title>
    <para>
        Even though the result of any JPQL query is always a single object/primitive or a collection of objects/primitives,
        the language provides a mechanism to assemble a new objects from queries via <literal>SELECT NEW</literal>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
SELECT NEW za.co.academics.UniversityInfo (u.name, u.address, c.name c.registeredStudents)
    FROM University u JOIN u.course c WHERE c.registeredStudents > 100
    ]]></programlisting>
        creates a list of result objects which are populated from elements of the university and course entities.

  <title>Deploying Enterprise Beans into a partition</title>
  <para>
    So far we have assigned instances of the application server to a cluster
    and ensured that there is a fail-safe HA-JNDI naming service for the 
    cluster. We now have to deploy enterprise beans into that partition.
  </para>
  <para>
    To this end we have to specify, at deployment time, the cluster into
    which a bean is deployed (particularly since a server instance can 
    belong to multiple clusters).

    <title>Clustering stateless session beans</title>
    <para>
      Clustering is purely a deployment aspect and specifying deployment to
      a partition requires only the specification of the partition name and
      the load-balancing policy for both, the home and remote interfaces.

      <title>jboss.xml</title>
      <para>
        This is done in the <literal>jboss.xml</literal> file. For example, is we have
        a session bean, <literal>ClusteringTest</literal>  which we would like to deploy
        into, say, the default partition, then the <literal>jboss.xml</literal> could
        look as follows:

Typically one wants to deploy all beans available within a cluster
This is accross all nodes of the cluster.

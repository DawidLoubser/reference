   The remote interface is the central interface for clients, <ns1901:abbrev xmlns:ns1901="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">i.e.</ns1901:abbrev> it represents 
   the client view of the enterprise bean. The remote interface specifies the services the
   enterprise bean offers to clients.

     The remote interface is very similar to a CORBA interface
     in that it provides clients with a view of the services being offered without being coupled to a
     particular implementation through which the services will be provided.

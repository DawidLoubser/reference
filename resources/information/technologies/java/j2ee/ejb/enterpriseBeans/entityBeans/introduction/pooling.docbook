    In principle entity beans could be created as clients require access to information
    encapsulated by these beans and destroyed as the client no longer requires the information
    or when the client disconnects. In practice this may lead to a huge number of object
    creations and destructions with the corresponding computational overheads.

    In order to ensure a better scalability, application servers typically pool entity
    objects, not only for use of a particular instance but also accross instances of the same
    class. For example, a student entity object may be reused for different students.

    Beans in the pool should be able to release and acquire resources upon releasing the
    bean back to the pool and reactivating the bean. To this end the container makes two
    call-backs to the bean: ejbActivate() in which bean resources like sockets are acquired.
    The bean is associated with a particular primary key and the bean state is populated after
    activation via a call to <ns1509:literal xmlns:ns1509="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">ejbLoad()</ns1509:literal>. ejbPassivate() in
    which bean resources are released after the state of the bean has been saved into
    persistent storage (The container calls <ns1510:literal xmlns:ns1510="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">ejbStore()</ns1510:literal>
    before calling <ns1511:literal xmlns:ns1511="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">ejbActivate()</ns1511:literal>. The link between the EJB
    object and the primary key is broken during passivation.

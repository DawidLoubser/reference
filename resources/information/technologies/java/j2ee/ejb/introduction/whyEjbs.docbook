    So, why is there a need for Enterprise Java Beans? Even with Java's support for RMI and
    CORBA, the development of robust, secure and efficient distributed systems is still a
    technically non-trivial process. Servers must be able to support many clients concurrently
    in a save way. Furthermore, these applications should be scalable with full support for
    transactions and persistence. In addition to all this, one would also like portability
    between server platforms.

    Enterprise Java Beans where designed to address all these issues in such a way that the
    server side development should be simplified considerably.

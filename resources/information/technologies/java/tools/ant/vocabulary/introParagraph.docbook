  For each Ant project one defines a build file. The build file may contain multiple
  <emphasis>targets</emphasis>, with dependencies between them. Each target may specify 
    a number of tasks to be performed. This build file is typically (though not necessarily) called
    <literal>build.xml</literal>.

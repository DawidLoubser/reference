    <title>How Maven uses Respositories</title>
    <para>
        When Maven resolves dependencies, it sources the the metadata (POM) for the dependency
        from either the local cache repository or one of the remote repositories. From the POM
        it obtains the transitive dependencies. This is done recursively building up a dependency tree.
    </para>
    <para>
        Maven will attempt to resolve any conflicts and then will source the actual artifacts for the
        dependencies, looking first in the local cache before trying to source them remotely. The
        integrity of any sourced dependency is validated using the hash which is also obtained
        from the repository.

    <title>Assembling higher level views from lower level views</title>
    <para>
        We can easily aggregate composite views from lower level view components. However,
        each component has an associated backing bean which manages the state for that component.
        The backing beans for the higher level view components needs to extract the lower level
        state components from the lower level backing beans in order to assemble higher level
        data structures representing the composite views. To this end the lower level binding
        components need to be injected into the binding components of the higher level views.

    <title>Dependency relationships in Java</title>
    <para> Dependency relationships are not explicitly specified in Java. They would be implicit by,
        for example, defining in the class specification that an instance of a particular class is
        provided with a service request, or by specifying in the dynamic model that at some stage in
        the business process, an instance of one class is created from within an instance of the
        class hosting the business process. </para>

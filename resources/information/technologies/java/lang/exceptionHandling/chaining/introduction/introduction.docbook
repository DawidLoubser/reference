    When exception handling is implemented correctly, it provides useful information to a user when an exception occurs. 
    One of the features of JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition Version 1.4.0, exception chaining, assists in doing that at the 
    lowest level of exception reporting. Exception chaining allows you to transfer control of your custom designed exception handling code. It has eliminated the loss of lower level exception
    information when a new exception is thrown.

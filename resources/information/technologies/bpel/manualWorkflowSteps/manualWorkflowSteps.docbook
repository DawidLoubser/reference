  <title>WS-BPEL and manual work flow steps</title>
  <para>
    WS-BPEL itself does not currently have explicit support for manual (human) work flow steps - it merely interacts
    with service providers and consumers. Most WS-BPEL processes will be executed in a container which is plugged
    into an ESB, however, and the ESB may offer any number of binding components (protocol adaptors) through which
    a service request may be routed to a human, and the response returned to the BPEL process.
